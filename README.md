In this project we have a dataset of 506 houses that each house has 14 parameter.
In the project I've handle the missed value and draw the hexbin, correlation heatmap and scatter plot for the houses.
In the next phase I divide the data set into test and training and implement linear regression.
Then I've traing my model with the best parameter and check the accuracy of my model using recall, precision and so on.
